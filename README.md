# RLPeerPrediction

In this project, we aim at combining reinforcement learning with incentive mechanisms to get rid of agents' bounded rationality.

This project includes five modules (classes), namely, RL, Inference, Mechanism, Crowdsourcing Market and the simulation controller.

This project is written in Python.
