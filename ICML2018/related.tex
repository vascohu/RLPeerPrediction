Peer prediction \cite{Prelec:2004,MRZ:2005,jurca2006minimum,jurca2009mechanisms,witkowski2012robust,witkowski2012peer,radanovic2013,dasgupta2013crowdsourced}, a class of mechanisms that have been developed extensively recently, are often adopted for incentivizing truthful or high-quality contributions from strategic sources when the quality of the contributions cannot be verified. %The Bayesian Truth Serum was proposed in \cite{Prelec:2004} to elicit truthful report when only minority of the crowd holds the true answer. 
Particularly, the seminal work \cite{MRZ:2005} established that strictly proper scoring rule \cite{Gneiting:07} can be adopted in the peer prediction setting for eliciting truthful reports; following which a sequence of followed up works have been done on relaxing the assumptions that have been imposed therein \cite{witkowski2012robust,witkowski2012peer,radanovic2013}. More recently, \cite{Witkowski_hcomp13,dasgupta2013crowdsourced} formally introduced and studied an effort sensitive model for binary signal data elicitation. Particularly \cite{dasgupta2013crowdsourced} proposed a multi-task peer prediction mechanism that can help remove undesirable equilibria that lead to low quality reports. These results are further strengthened and extended to a non-binary signal setting in \cite{2016arXiv160303151S,kong2016framework}. One set of studies focuses on using models that aggregate tasks from different agents \cite{kamar2012incentives,faltings2014incentive,radanovic2016incentives}. These work do not consider a machine learning setting, and have not established a rigorous analysis.
